# CSID
A radio identification source.
This is a program that I got from another (public domaine) programer.
I want to modify it so that pin 6 is reset when it sees a voltage of up to 5 volts.
I want to also make pin 9 go to ground when it sees a 0 (groundes state).
I want it to send the code at the beginning of the first pulse, wait 10 minutes then send again.
If there is no activity I want it to remain sielent until it sees either a 5 volt pulse on pin 6 or a 0 state on pin 9.
